## Earthquakes with Magnitude â‰¥6.0 from 1 Jan 2019 to 12 Jul 2019

Data was sourced on 12 Jul 2019 from the [**European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre CSEM** website](https://www.emsc-csem.org/Earthquake/). The `csv` data file can be found in the same GitHub repository this webpage is hosted in.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
library(leaflet)

df <- read.csv("export_EMSC.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ";")

df$popup <- paste(df$Date, df$Time.UTC, "<br>",
                  "Magnitude:", df$Magnitude, "<br>",
                 df$Region.Name)

df$label <- paste(df$Date, df$Time.UTC, "Magnitude:", df$Magnitude, df$Region.Name)

df %>% 
  leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles(urlTemplate = "https://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/World_Imagery/MapServer/tile/{z}/{y}/{x}", 
           attribution = "Tiles &copy; Esri &mdash; Source: Esri, i-cubed, USDA, USGS, AEX, GeoEye, Getmapping, Aerogrid, IGN, IGP, UPR-EGP, and the GIS User Community") %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = df$Longitude, 
             lat = df$Latitude, 
             popup = df$popup,
             label = df$label) %>% 
  addCircles(lng = df$Longitude, 
             lat = df$Latitude,
             weight = 1,
             radius = df$Magnitude^6.75, # change this value to scale the circles
             color = "red",
             fillColor = "orange",
             fillOpacity = 0.3)
```
